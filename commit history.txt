To show how I work through my commit history, I would commit changes as I make progress on the project, with each commit message describing the changes made in that commit. For example:

1.Initial commit: Set up Spring Boot project structure and dependencies.
2.Add drone entity and repository classes.
3.Implement drone registration endpoint.
4.Implement medication loading endpoint and check weight limit.
5.Implement battery level check for LOADING state.
6.Add periodic task to check battery levels and log events.
7.Update README with build/run/test instructions.
8.Add dummy data for testing.
9Write JUnit tests for endpoints.
10.Final commit: Clean up code and documentation for submission.
